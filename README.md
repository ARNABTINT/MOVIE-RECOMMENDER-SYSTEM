Movie recommender system: This is a software application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences or past behavior. There are two main approaches:

Content-based filtering: Recommends movies similar to ones the user liked before. This might consider genres, actors, directors, or keywords.
Collaborative filtering: Recommends movies that other users with similar tastes enjoyed.
TMDB dataset: TMDB is a community-driven online database that provides information about movies, TV shows, actors, and crew members. They offer a dataset you can download, containing details on thousands of movies. This data is useful for building a movie recommender system.
